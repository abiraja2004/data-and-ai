Data Lakes will be central to the modern data architecture because of these features:

-   Agility: ability to convert data \>\> information \>\> action
-   Insight: ability to give business insights
-   Scalability: ability to accommodate data growth

**All data is welcome:**

-   Stores all type of data: structured, semi-structured & unstructured
-   Stores raw data in its original form for extended period of time
-   Uses various tools to correlate, enrich & query for the insights on the data
-   Provides democratized access via single unified view across the Enterprise

**Traditional Data Architecture**

Sources \>\> ETL \>\> EDW \>\> Data Discovery/Analytics/BI

**Modern Data Architecture**

Streaming/Unstructured/Various Sources \>\> Data Lake (Derived/Discovery Sandbox) \>\> EDW \>\> Data Science/Data Discovery/Analytics/BI
