            "title": "Useful Resources to Learn Artificial Intelligence",
            "content": ". While you are learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) and looking to get into this exciting field, you may wonder which are the resources to refer, how do you know if a book or course is worth to spend time and/or money? . Due to close association between Data Science (DS), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), these terms have been used in this article interchangeably. . This is not an exhaustive list by any means, but it is good enough to keep as your reference. You can build your own list of references once you get more awareness of the field. . [embed]https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2019/03/01/the-myth-of-ais-predictive-power/[/embed] . This post is my attempt to make your task easier. I am listing down major quality resources (mostly free) here and also going to provide you with my view of these resources, which will help you to make an informed decision. . . You need not go through each and every resource mentioned here, I would suggest you build the foundation first using a course or a book and keep other resources for your reference. . Books to refer . . Machine Learning with R . This is an excellent book for the R starter who wants to apply ML to any kind of project. All the main ML models are presented, as well as different performance metrics, bagging, pruning, tuning, ensembling etc. Easy to scan through, many tips with fully-solved textbook problems. Certainly, a very good starting point if you plan to compete on Kaggle. If you already master both R and ML, this books is obviously not for you. . [embed]https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2019/03/01/the-myth-of-ais-predictive-power/[/embed] . Python Machine Learning . This is a fantastic introductory book in machine learning with python. It provides enough background about the theory of each (covered) technique followed by its python code. One nice thing about the book is that it starts implementing Neural Networks from scratch, providing the reader with the chance of truly understanding the key underlying techniques such as back-propagation. Even further, the book presents an efficient (and professional) way of coding in python, the key to AI/ML. . [embed]https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2019/03/01/the-myth-of-ais-predictive-power/[/embed] . ISLR . The book explains the concepts of Statistical Learning from the very beginning. The core ideas such as bias-variance trade-off are deeply discussed and revisited in many problems. The included R examples are particularly helpful for beginners to learn R. The book also provides a brief, but concise description of functions’ parameters for many related R packages. Compared to The Elements of Statistical Learning, it is easy for the reader to understand. It does a wonderful job of breaking things down complex concepts. If one wishes to learn more about a particular topic, I’d recommend The Element of Statistical Learning. These two pair nicely together. . [embed]https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2019/03/01/the-myth-of-ais-predictive-power/[/embed] . Deep Learning . This is the book to read on deep learning. Written by luminaries in the field — if you’ve read any papers on deep learning, you must have heard about Goodfellow and Bengio before — and cutting through much of the BS surrounding the topic: like ‘big data’ before it, ‘deep learning’ is not something new and is not deserving of a special name. Networks with more hidden layers to detect higher-order features, networks of different types chained together in order to play to their strengths, graphs of networks to represent a probabilistic model. . This is a theoretical book, but it can be read in tandem with Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow, almost chapter-for-chapter. The Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow example code, while only moderately interesting on its own, helps to clarify the purpose of many of the topics in the Goodfellow book. . [embed]https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2019/03/01/the-myth-of-ais-predictive-power/[/embed] . Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow . This book provides a great introduction to machine learning for both developer and non-developers. Authors suggest to just go through even if you don’t understand math details. Highlights of this book are: . Extraction of field expert knowledge is very important, you should know which model will serve better for the given solution. Luckily, a lot of models are available already from other scientists. | Training data is the most important part, the more you have it the better. So if you can you should accumulate as much data as you can, preferably categorized, you may not still know how you will apply the accumulated data in the future but you will need it. | Labelling training data is very important too, to train neural network you need to have at least thousands of labelled data samples, the more the better. | Machine learning algorithms and neural networks are pretty common for years but the latest breakthrough is possible because of new optimization, new autoencoders ( that may help to artificially generate training data) allowing to do training faster and with fewer data. | Machine learning is still pretty time and resources consuming process. To train a machine learning model you need to know how to tweak parameters and how to use different training approaches fitting the particular model. | . The book demonstrates (including the code) different approaches using Scikit-Learn python package and also the TensorFlow. . [embed]https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2019/03/01/the-myth-of-ais-predictive-power/[/embed] . Data Science for Business . This is probably the most practical book to read if you are looking for an overview of data science. Either you know when terms like k-means and ROC curves are to be used or you have some context when you start digging deeper into how some of these algorithms are implemented. You will find it at the right level because there is just enough math to explain the fundamental concepts and make them stick in your head. . This isn’t a book on implementing these concepts or a bunch of algorithms. This gives the book the advantage of being something you can refer to an intelligent manager or interested developer, and they can both get a lot out of it. And if they are interested in the next level of learning there are plenty of pointers. You will also find the chapter on presenting results through ROC curves, lift curves, etc. pretty interesting. It would be cool if this book had some more hands-on, but you can go to Kaggle and browse around the current and past competitions to apply what you learn here. . https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449361323/ . Courses to attend . . Machine Learning . . https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning . Machine Learning is one of the first programming MOOCs. Coursera put online by Coursera founder and Stanford Professor Andrew Ng. This course assumes that you have basic programming skills and you have some understanding of Linear Algebra. Knowledge of Statistics &amp; Probability is not required though. . Andrew Ng does a good job explaining dense material and slides. The course gives you a lot of structure and direction for each homework, so it is generally pretty clear what you are supposed to do and how you are supposed to do it. . Deep Learning . . When you are rather new to the topic, you can learn a lot of doing the deeplearning.ai specialization. First and foremost, you learn the basic concepts of NN. How does a forward pass in simple sequential models look like, what’s a backpropagation, and so on? I experienced this set of courses as a very time-effective way to learn the basics and worth more than all the tutorials, blog posts and talks, which I went through beforehand. . Doing this specialization is probably more than the first step into DL. I would say, each course is a single step in the right direction, so you end up with five steps in total. I think it builds a fundamental understanding of the field. But going further, you have to practice a lot and eventually it might be useful also to read more about the methodological background of DL variants. But doing the course work gets you started in a structured manner — which is worth a lot, especially in a field with so much buzz around it. . [embed]https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2019/03/01/the-myth-of-ais-predictive-power/[/embed] . Fast AI . . If your goal is to be able to learn about deep learning and apply what you’ve learned, the fast.ai course is a better bet. If you have the time, interleaving the deeplearning.ai and fast.ai courses is ideal — you get the practical experience, applicability, and audience interaction of fast.ai, along with the organised material and theoretical explanations of deeplearning.ai. . [embed]https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2019/03/01/the-myth-of-ais-predictive-power/[/embed] . Kaggle Learn . .

HackerMath for Machine Learning . . Math literacy, including proficiency in Linear Algebra and Statistics, is a must for anyone pursuing a career in data science. The goal of this workshop is to introduce some key concepts from these domains that get used repeatedly in data science/AI applications. . As outlined by Amit Kapoor, “Our approach is what we call the ‘Hacker’s way’. Instead of going back to formulae and proofs, we teach the concepts by writing code. And in practical applications. Concepts don’t remain sticky if the usage is never taught.” . The focus here is on depth rather than breadth. Three areas are chosen — Hypothesis Testing, Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning. They are covered to sufficient depth — 50% of the time on the concepts and 50% of the time spent coding them. .

            "title": "Artificial Intelligence from Novice to Professional",
            "content": ". Why this post? . There is a general notion that Artificial Intelligence is all about algorithms. If you look around most of the courses, books, blogs, etc, you will find that most of them cover how you can apply certain algorithms and further optimize those algorithms. . After working on a few real-world AI/ML projects, you will realize that while algorithms are at the core, AI is much more than algorithms. From identifying &amp; assessing AI opportunities in your organization/department to deploying and maintaining the solutions in production, a lot goes into AI/ML projects. . In this post, I am going to briefly touch every aspect of AI/ML project lifecycle. The good news is, as a data scientist you need not master every aspect, but knowing those areas to some extent will help you contribute better in real-world projects. . A single post can’t make you an AI professional, but it can ask relevant questions &amp; increase awareness, seeking answers to these questions can help you build your own AI roadmap. . We can segregate all these aspects of AI into 5 parts: AI Introduction, AI Pre-requisites, AI Concepts &amp; Algorithms, Enterprise AI &amp; Peripherals of AI . I. AI Introduction . AI is a team game, every aspiring AI role needs to have a common understanding of AI/ML field. This part covers a simple What, Why &amp; How of AI: . — Why you should learn AI? . — Why AI is important? . — What is Artificial Intelligence? . — How an end-to-end AI project looks like? . — What are the roles in AI projects and who does what? . II. AI Pre-requisites . AI/ML has a steep learning curve because it is an amalgamation of many fields (Statistics, IT &amp; Domain etc). And some knowledge of these fields is required before you can start grasping AI/ML concepts. This part covers the pre-requisites of AI: . — What topics of maths you should cover? . — What programming languages, libraries &amp; frameworks you should be aware of? . — How does data move in an organization? . — How is it stored and processed? . III. AI Concepts &amp; Algorithms . AI/ML in itself is quite a vast field and have different techniques and frameworks to deal with different kind of real-world problems. This part covers major AI/ML techniques and what to use when: . — What are the major types of AI techniques? . — When to use what? Main concepts &amp; algorithms ML, DL &amp; RL? . IV. Enterprise AI . Learning AI/ML concepts &amp; algorithms are not enough, you will be solving some business problems with what you have learned. You need to be aware of what happens when these concepts &amp; algorithms are applied within an enterprise. This part covers the aspects of enterprise AI: . - What is the difference between Hackathons &amp; Real-world projects? . - How to operationalize AI? . - How to build AI Strategy? . - Why ethics &amp; explainability is important &amp; how can we make AI explainable? . V. Peripherals of AI . Apart from learning concepts and their applications, you may have specific needs at the moment like you want to get into the AI field or you need to lead an AI initiative in your organization. This part covers those specific needs: . - How you can get into AI field? . - How to lead AI initiatives in your organization? . - How to future-proof your AI career? . Conclusion . I hope by now you have got an idea of what it takes to work on AI projects in the real world. Due to different but overlapping fields, it is really hard to get in-depth knowledge of every aspect of an AI aspirant. . But what you can do is to build a T-shape skill-set in the AI field, where you go in-depth in the aspect of your choice and have handy knowledge of other related aspects. . I will cover the above-mentioned aspects of AI thoroughly in upcoming posts, stay tuned. . . Ankit Rathi is an AI architect, published author &amp; well-known speaker.

            "title": "4 Types of Challenges in DS/AI Projects & Initiatives",
            "content": ". In this post, I have analyzed frequent challenges encountered by DS/AI leaders &amp; experts in their projects/initiatives. I have re-organized these challenges into 4 areas of concerns, my idea is to build a framework around these challenges to suggest possible solutions in upcoming posts. . . DS/AI promises considerable economic &amp; social benefits, even as it disrupts the way we work. Almost everyone agrees that it is a field which can change the world, from healthcare to countering terrorism and even arts &amp; sports. . DS/AI leaders &amp; experts are facing different challenges from ideation to productization, it is estimated that between 70% and 85% of DS/AI projects fail. . To get a holistic view of the challenges &amp; failures, I looked at various articles available on the internet about the challenges in DS/AI projects &amp; initiatives. You can find all the articles I referred at the end of this post. . In the past few weeks, I have also spoken to many DS/AI leaders &amp; experts on this topic and they have also given some useful insights. I will cover these specific insights into the challenges in the upcoming blog-posts. . In order to shed some light on the reasons why we observe such a high failure rate, I also analyzed the results of a survey conducted by Kaggle in 2017. You can see the full report here. The part of the survey relevant to this article is about the challenges companies face as far as their DS/AI efforts are concerned. The following chart shows the top fifteen challenges: . . While I am still documenting the challenges &amp; possible solutions, I can categorize these challenges in four broad segments: — Cultural challenges (right talent, data literacy, realistic expectations etc) — Data-related challenges (data access, data quality, lifecycle management etc) — Operational challenges (suitable operating model with specific roles &amp; responsibilities) — Technology-related challenges (appropriate tech-stack, right infrastructure etc). . . Challenges in DS/AI Projects . Based on the above-mentioned sources (surveys, articles &amp; experts) in this post, I have collected all the challenges and tried to categorize them into four areas of concern — Culture, Operation, Data, Technology: . Data Quality — Data | Talent Gap — Operations | Company Politics — Culture | Data Access — Operations | Data Literacy — Culture | Data Privacy — Data | SME Gap — Operations | Heterogeneous Tech-stack — Technology | Unrealistic Expectations — Culture | Co-ordination with IT &amp; other deptt — Operations | Stakeholders’ Buy-in — Culture | Sponsorship — Culture | Deployment — Operations | Algorithms Limitations — Technology | Data Consolidation — Data | Opportunity Assessment — Operations | Model Explainability — Technology | Agility — Operations | Data Security — Operations | Solving the Wrong Problem — Operations | Organizational Maturity — Culture | Storytelling — Culture | . Area of Concerns in DS/AI . Now, let’s consolidate the above challenges in the respective area of concerns: . Cultural Challenges . Company Politics, Data Literacy, Unrealistic Expectations, Stakeholders’ Buy-in, Organizational Maturity, Storytelling . Operational Challenges . Talent Gap, Data Access, SME Gap, Coordination with IT and other deptts, Deployment, Opportunity Assessment, Data Security, Solving the Wrong Problem . Data Challenges . Data Quality, Data Privacy, Data Consolidation . Technology Challenges . Heterogeneous Tech-stack, Algorithms Limitations, Model Explainability . What next? . I believe that if we categorize these challenges in the respective area of concerns, we can build a framework around it which can address these challenges and suggest possible solutions. . I intend to explore these possibilities in the upcoming blog-posts, if it looks interesting to you, stay tuned. . . Thank you for reading my post.
