            "content": ". Want to learn more? visit www.ankitrathi.com . I am working in ML/AI field for 6 years now and apart from technical skills that I acquired while working on the projects, I have also discussed various aspects of ML/AI with my non-technical colleagues, who have mostly been senior manager, VPs or CXOs. . When I heard about “AI For Everyone” course, I was a bit reluctant in attending it as I thought I know most of the generic stuff that might have been talked in the course. . Recently, one of my colleagues discussed with me a few topics covered in this course which intrigued me to get a fresh perspective on these topics. So, I recently attended this course on Coursera. . My motivation to write this blog is to make sure that I have understood key aspects of this course and am able to make my non-technical colleagues and project stakeholders understand the benefits &amp; limitations of using AI. . This blog will also serve as a refresher for the professionals who have already attended it or are working in AI field but couldn’t attend the course due to time limitation. . Review of the Course . “AI For Everyone” is a short non-technical course which helps to bridge the gap among corporate professionals who are going to be impacted by AI transformation now or in the near future. Even the professionals without programming background understand the capabilities and limitations of today’s AI, what it takes to incorporate AI into your company’s strategy, how some of the fear regarding AI is overhyped and finally many serious questions like how AI will impact repetitive automation-prone jobs. . Key aspects of this course are: . A non-technical overview of AI field | Mainly for non-technical staff including executives (VPs &amp; CXOs) | Refresher for AI starters &amp; enthusiasts | Brings all stakeholders for AI projects on the same page | Mostly covers benefits &amp; limitations of AI | . In my view, the most important benefit of this course is that it brings all the professionals on the same page about what is AI? What are its capabilities? Which really fills a lot of gaps for the people joining AI projects from different background and reduces the friction while working together. . Outline of the Course . Let’s have a look at what we are going to learn in this course: . First week: AI technology, what is AI and what is machine learning? What’s supervised learning, that is learning inputs, outputs, or A to B mappings. As well as what is data science, and how data feeds into all of these technologies? What AI can and cannot do? | Second week: What it feels like to build an AI project? What is the workflow of machine learning projects, of collecting data, building a system and deploying it, as well as the workflow of data science projects? How to carry out technical diligence to make sure a project is feasible, together with business diligence to make sure that the project is valuable before you commit to taking on a specific AI project? | Third week: How such AI projects could fit in the context of our company? Examples of complex AI products, such as a smart speaker, a self-driving car. What are the roles and responsibilities of large AI teams? The AI transmission playbook, what are the five-steps for helping a company become a great AI company? | Last week: AI and Society. What are the limitations of AI beyond just technical ones? How AI is affecting developing economies and jobs worldwide? | . Week 1: What is AI? . . This week’s content contains all the essentials for understanding AI, its capabilities, limitations, and how to implement it in a company’s automated processes to become an AI company. . Introduction . AI is creating value in almost all the sectors | Artificial Intelligence can be categorized broadly into two streams: ANI &amp; AGI | Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): Machine can do whatever a human can do | Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI): Machine can do very specific tasks like driving cars, playing asked music, searching web etc | What we know how to develop today are ANIs, each specialized in one task | AGI doesn’t exist yet (at least for a long time from now) | . Machine Learning . AI has really taken off recently due to the rise of neural networks and deep learning | In the majority of the cases: AI → Machine Learning → Supervised Learning | Supervised Learning learns the mapping between input A to output B | . What is data . We know that Supervised Learning learns the mapping between input A to output B | Examples of input A &amp; output B from which ML algorithms learn is called data | Data is often unique to your business, can be structured (tables, hierarchy etc), unstructured ( text, voice and image) or semi-structured | Data can be obtained by: manual labeling, observing behaviours or download from websites/partnerships | Pre-process the data before using it for AI models: garbage in, garbage out | Most of the data problems are related to incorrect labels &amp; missing values | . The terminology of AI . Business Intelligence (BI) helps interpret past data, BI is mainly used for reporting or Descriptive Analytics. | Data Science is the science of extracting knowledge and insights from data which often ends up being captured in a deck. | Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. | The Machine Learning which is a subset of the AI ​​itself contains subsets of which the most powerful is the Deep Learning (DL). | Originally inspired by neural networks of the brain, DL models are composed of several layers of computational units (artificial neurons), each capable of detecting more and more complicated characteristics of a training dataset | . What makes an AI company? . Any company + deep learning != AI company | Strategic data acquisition | Unified data warehouse | Pervasive automation | New roles &amp; division of labour | . 5 steps to becoming an AI company . Execute pilot projects to gain momentum | Build an in-house AI team | Provide broad AI training | Develop an AI strategy | Develop internal &amp; external communications | . What Machine Learning can and cannot do . ML/AI can’t do everything | Expectations are inflated due to media, academics &amp; only positive reports about AI | Imperfect rule: Whatever we could do with a second of thought can probably be automated using AI | Technical diligence is required to assess the feasibility of the project | It is still harder to contextualize the responses for AI models | ML tends to work well in learning a simple concept with lots of available data | ML tends to work poorly in learning a complex concept, especially from small amount of data or if performing on new type of data | . Intuitive explanation of deep learning . Week 2: Building AI Projects . . The content of this week contains all the essentials for developing an AI project (large or small) and understanding how all jobs will be impacted by AI. . Workflow of a Machine Learning project . Collect data | Train model (iterate until its good enough) | Deploy model (get data back, maintain/update model) | . Workflow of a Data Science project . Collect data | Analyse data (iterate until its good enough) | Suggest hypotheses/actions (deploy changes, re-analyse periodically) | . Every job function needs to learn to use data . Increasing sales: optimizing sales funnel &amp; automated lead sorting | Default detection: optimizing manufacturing line &amp; automated visual inspection | Recruitment assistance: optimizing recruitment funnel &amp; automated resume screening | Product recommendation: A/B testing &amp; customized product recommendation | Precision agriculture: crop analytics &amp; precise weed killing | . How to choose an AI project . organize a cross-functional brainstorming with both the AI and domain teams | Cross-section between ‘What AI can do’ &amp; ‘What is valuable for your business’ | Which either increase revenue or reduce costs or both | Use/buy standard AI models and develop only which don’t exist or offer extra business value | . Method I . Automation of processes/tasks rather than jobs | Selection of activities with the greatest impact on the company’s business | Selection of the main pain points in the company’s business | . Method II . Technical diligence in terms of state of the art AI capability, data requirements &amp; time and people required to create, train &amp; deploy AI models | Business diligence in terms of cost reduction, revenue increment &amp; new product/business opportunity | Ethical considerations | . Working with an AI team . Instead of hiring AI specialist, train IT engineers in AI | Domain team must define the performance rate to be achieved by the AI ​​model | Not realistic to ask the AI ​​team to obtain a 100% performance rate | Due to limitations of ML, insufficient data, mislabelled data | . Technical tools for AI teams . AI ​​evolves largely in the Open Source world | Free ML/DL high-quality frameworks | Academic research papers in ML/DL | Refer Arxiv for research publications | Refer GitHub for Open Source repositories | AI ​​team must also have the significant computational capacity (GPU) | Can be local or by prominent cloud providers (AWS, Azure &amp; GCP) | . Big data is not always required . Having more data almost never hurts | Data makes some businesses defensible | But with small data, you can still make progress | . Week 3: Building AI in your Company . . This week’s content contains all the essential elements for developing AI in an organization (association, public organization, company). . Case study: Smart speaker . Typical examples: Amazon Echo/Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri, Baidu DuerOS | Steps to process the voice command: | . — Trigger word/wakeword detection . — Speech recognition . — Intent recognition . — Execute task . Usually, there is one AI team per process | Execution of the task may be more complex to be broken down in further sub-tasks | Example tasks: play music, volume up/down, make call, current time etc | . Case study: Self-driving car . There are 3 main steps for a self-driving car to decide on its route and speed | But there are many other localization processes that are necessary for the decision | Key steps: Car detection → Pedestrian detection → Motion planning | . Example roles of an AI team . Software Engineer: 50% or more of the team, in charge of developing software | ML Engineer: responsible for creating and training ML models | ML Researcher: in charge of following the evolution of state-of-the-art, doing research and possibly publishing the results of its research | Applied ML Scientist: in charge of adapting already published models to the specific projects of its company. | Data Scientist: responsible for examining the data and providing the insights to AI team/executives | Data Engineer: in charge of organizing and saving data in an accessible, secure and cost-effective way | AI Product Manager: help AI team in deciding what to build, what’s feasible &amp; valuable | Start with a small team and expand based on the progress | . AI Transformation Playbook . Execute pilot projects to gain momentum | Build an in-house AI team | Provide broad AI training | Develop an AI strategy | Develop internal &amp; external communications | . AI pitfalls to avoid . Don’t expect AI to solve each and everything | Don’t depend solely on the technical team to come up with AI use-cases | Don’t expect the AI project to work the first time | Don’t expect traditional planning &amp; processes to apply without any changes | Don’t think you need superstar AI engineer to succeed | . Taking your first step in AI . Get colleagues to learn about AI | Start brainstorming about projects | Hire a few ML/AI people to help | Hire or appoint an AI leader | Discuss with CXOs/Board about possibilities of AI transformations | . Survey of major AI applications . Computer Vision: Image classification, Object recognition, Object detection, Image segmentation, Tracking | Natural Language Processing: Text classification, Information retrieval, Name entity recognition, Machine translation | Speech: Speech recognition, Trigger word/wakeword detection, Speaker ID, Speech synthesis | Robotics: Perception, Motion planning, Control | General Machine Learning: Unstructured data (image, audio, text), Structured data | . Survey of major AI techniques . Unsupervised learning | Transfer learning | Reinforcement learning | Generative Adversarial Network (GANs) | Knowledge Graph | . Week 4: AI and Society . . This week’s content contains all the essentials to understand the impacts of AI on our society. . A realistic view of AI . Too optimistic: Sentient/super-intelligent AI killer robots coming soon | Too pessimistic: AI cannot do everything, so an AI winter is coming | Just right: AI can’t do each and everything, but will transform industries | Performance limitations: with unavailability of data, less or irrelevant data or randomness of patterns can limit the performance | Model explainability: explainable models are more accepted in business &amp; society | . Discrimination / Bias . AI model may develop gender and ethnic biases | Problem comes from the training data which contain these biases | Examples such as: | . — Hiring tool discriminating against women . — Facial recognition working better for light-skinned individuals . — Bank loan approvals . — Toxic effect of reinforcing unhealthy stereotypes . Combating bias: | . — Technical solutions: removing bias in training data, using more inclusive data . — Transparency and/or auditing processes . — Having a diverse workforce . Adversarial attacks . AL models are sensitive to adversarial attacks | Which are deliberate actions to fool an AI model | It is possible by changing the values ​​of a few pixels of an image to fool a classifier | While visually we (humans) can not detect the changes | Adversarial defence do exist, but incur some cost | Endless race between forgers and authorities | . Adverse uses . DeepFakes: Synthesize video of people doing things they never did | Undermining of democracy &amp; privacy | Generating fake comments | . AI and developing nations . Developing economies can ‘leapfrog’ by using technology developed by others | Like mobile phones, mobile payments, online education | Use applied AI in specific industries | Public-private partnerships to accelerate development | Invent in AI education of citizen | . AI and jobs . Automation of activities by AI already has an impact on employment | But job created by AI should be much higher than job displaced by 2030 | We should assess what are the tasks in our day-to-day job which can be automated | Possibility of conditional basic income | Building a lifelong learning society | Political solutions to support AI transformation in society | We should all complement our current knowledge with an AI knowledge | . Conclusion . Let’s recap what we have learnt in this course: . First week: AI technology, what is AI and what is machine learning? What’s supervised learning, that is learning inputs, outputs, or A to B mappings. As well as what is data science, and how data feeds into all of these technologies? What AI can and cannot do? | Second week: What it feels like to build an AI project? What is the workflow of machine learning projects, of collecting data, building a system and deploying it, as well as the workflow of data science projects? How to carry out technical diligence to make sure a project is feasible, together with business diligence to make sure that the project is valuable before you commit to taking on a specific AI project? | Third week: How such AI projects could fit in the context of our company? Examples of complex AI products, such as a smart speaker, a self-driving car. What are the roles and responsibilities of large AI teams? The AI transmission playbook, what are the five-steps for helping a company become a great AI company? | Last week: AI and Society. What are the limitations of AI beyond just technical ones? How AI is affecting developing economies and jobs worldwide? | . We have learned a lot in these four weeks, but AI is a complex topic, so the key is to keep learning, keep evolving. . References .

            "title": "5 Tips for DS/AI Beginners & Enthusiasts",
            "content": ". In this post, I am sharing 5 important tips for budding data scientists, there is a bonus tip as well in the end. . . While I believe that the more you struggle, the more you get to learn in the process, you can still learn from experienced professionals to avoid common roadblocks or challenges. . DS/AI starters and enthusiasts keep interacting with me and I try to help them. Apart from common questions by them, I give them tips on how they can become effective in their DS/AI journey, i.e. what to focus and what to avoid etc. . Here I am sharing 5 of those tips: . Master The Basics . . Before you can work on any DS/AI problem, you need to master the basics. Understand the mathematics required for DS/AI, which is Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, Statistics &amp; Probability. . Then learn about frequently used algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest etc. Where to apply which algorithm and what are the advantages and limitations of using a particular algorithm. . Understand the overall process of working in DS/AI projects, from defining the problem to deploying the solution. . Improve your coding skills to execute &amp; validate your hypothesis efficiently. Python &amp; R are the two major languages preferred by data scientists. . Learn Just Enough . . DS/AI is a vast field, one can not be an expert overnight. The biggest mistake newbies do is to get stuck into an endless learning loop. . You are learning DS/AI is to solve real-world problems, so learn just enough concepts to get started. Participate in hackathons/competitions, practice on public datasets. . You need not read each book or attend every course on the planet before feeling confident to start with DS/AI. Just follow one decent book or course to build your basics and start working on problems. Keep the material (books &amp; courses) for reference in case you get stuck with your problem. . Handle Data Like a Pro . . Data is the heart of DS/AI initiatives &amp; projects. If you can’t handle data, you can’t make progress with your use case. Data handling can make or break any DS/AI project. . Build your skills in data handling, learn frequently used tips &amp; tricks in SQL, Pandas (in Python) or data.table (in R) to handle &amp; manipulate data efficiently. . Learn from Kaggle kernels, popular GitHub repos, how experts handle the data. Gather and clean public datasets on your own and refer these resources wherever get stuck. . . Before continuing with this post, if you are loving the content, check out my post on ‘How to launch your DS/AI Career in 12 weeks?’ . [embed]https://medium.com/ @rathi.ankit/how-to-launch-your-ds-ai-career-in-12-weeks-8a7e6950ffe6[/embed] . . Understand The Context . . As a newbie data scientist, you may be tempted to get the highest accuracy you can on any DS/AI problem you are working. But the real world is quite different, it’s not about the accuracy every time, many times robustness is very important and most of the time, the business may need models to be more interpretable. . Every framework, every feature has its own use case. If a particular approach worked in your previous project, the same may not work in the current one. As we say, there is no silver bullet in DS/AI field. . Hence understanding the context of the problem or the use case is important. . Improve Communication . . To understand the problem or use case, to get the overall context from business, to explain outcomes of your complex models requires excellent communication skills. . Presenting your approaches and findings to a non-technical audience, such as the marketing team or the CXOs, is a crucial part of being a data scientist. . You need to have the ability to interpret data, tell the stories contained therein, and in general, communicate, write and present well. Presentation, Storytelling, Data Visualization, Writing/Publishing, Business Insights, all are part of communication skills. . You may have to work hard to develop these skills — the same as you would with any technical skills. But with time and practice, you can get really good at it. . Bonus Tip: Develop T-shaped Skill-set . . DS/AI is an interdisciplinary field, and you can get expertise in one area at a time. Still, I would suggest you develop T-shaped skill-set to collaborate better with experts in other related fields working with you in the project. . T-shaped skills describe specific attributes of desirable workers. The vertical bar of the T refers to expert knowledge and experience in a particular area, while the top of the T refers to an ability to collaborate with experts in other disciplines and a willingness to use the knowledge gained from this collaboration. A t-shaped person is someone with t-shaped skills. . . Thank you for reading my post. I regularly write about Data &amp; Technology on LinkedIn &amp; Medium.

            "title": "Useful Resources to Learn Artificial Intelligence",
            "content": ". While you are learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) and looking to get into this exciting field, you may wonder which are the resources to refer, how do you know if a book or course is worth to spend time and/or money? . Due to close association between Data Science (DS), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), these terms have been used in this article interchangeably. . This is not an exhaustive list by any means, but it is good enough to keep as your reference. You can build your own list of references once you get more awareness of the field. . [embed]https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2019/03/01/the-myth-of-ais-predictive-power/[/embed] . This post is my attempt to make your task easier. I am listing down major quality resources (mostly free) here and also going to provide you with my view of these resources, which will help you to make an informed decision. . . You need not go through each and every resource mentioned here, I would suggest you build the foundation first using a course or a book and keep other resources for your reference. . Books to refer . . Machine Learning with R . This is an excellent book for the R starter who wants to apply ML to any kind of project. All the main ML models are presented, as well as different performance metrics, bagging, pruning, tuning, ensembling etc. Easy to scan through, many tips with fully-solved textbook problems. Certainly, a very good starting point if you plan to compete on Kaggle. If you already master both R and ML, this books is obviously not for you. . [embed]https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2019/03/01/the-myth-of-ais-predictive-power/[/embed] . Python Machine Learning . This is a fantastic introductory book in machine learning with python. It provides enough background about the theory of each (covered) technique followed by its python code. One nice thing about the book is that it starts implementing Neural Networks from scratch, providing the reader with the chance of truly understanding the key underlying techniques such as back-propagation. Even further, the book presents an efficient (and professional) way of coding in python, the key to AI/ML. . [embed]https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2019/03/01/the-myth-of-ais-predictive-power/[/embed] . ISLR . The book explains the concepts of Statistical Learning from the very beginning. The core ideas such as bias-variance trade-off are deeply discussed and revisited in many problems. The included R examples are particularly helpful for beginners to learn R. The book also provides a brief, but concise description of functions’ parameters for many related R packages. Compared to The Elements of Statistical Learning, it is easy for the reader to understand. It does a wonderful job of breaking things down complex concepts. If one wishes to learn more about a particular topic, I’d recommend The Element of Statistical Learning. These two pair nicely together. . [embed]https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2019/03/01/the-myth-of-ais-predictive-power/[/embed] . Deep Learning . This is the book to read on deep learning. Written by luminaries in the field — if you’ve read any papers on deep learning, you must have heard about Goodfellow and Bengio before — and cutting through much of the BS surrounding the topic: like ‘big data’ before it, ‘deep learning’ is not something new and is not deserving of a special name. Networks with more hidden layers to detect higher-order features, networks of different types chained together in order to play to their strengths, graphs of networks to represent a probabilistic model. . This is a theoretical book, but it can be read in tandem with Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow, almost chapter-for-chapter. The Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow example code, while only moderately interesting on its own, helps to clarify the purpose of many of the topics in the Goodfellow book. . [embed]https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2019/03/01/the-myth-of-ais-predictive-power/[/embed] . Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow . This book provides a great introduction to machine learning for both developer and non-developers. Authors suggest to just go through even if you don’t understand math details. Highlights of this book are: . Extraction of field expert knowledge is very important, you should know which model will serve better for the given solution. Luckily, a lot of models are available already from other scientists. | Training data is the most important part, the more you have it the better. So if you can you should accumulate as much data as you can, preferably categorized, you may not still know how you will apply the accumulated data in the future but you will need it. | Labelling training data is very important too, to train neural network you need to have at least thousands of labelled data samples, the more the better. | Machine learning algorithms and neural networks are pretty common for years but the latest breakthrough is possible because of new optimization, new autoencoders ( that may help to artificially generate training data) allowing to do training faster and with fewer data. | Machine learning is still pretty time and resources consuming process. To train a machine learning model you need to know how to tweak parameters and how to use different training approaches fitting the particular model. | . The book demonstrates (including the code) different approaches using Scikit-Learn python package and also the TensorFlow. . [embed]https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2019/03/01/the-myth-of-ais-predictive-power/[/embed] . Data Science for Business . This is probably the most practical book to read if you are looking for an overview of data science. Either you know when terms like k-means and ROC curves are to be used or you have some context when you start digging deeper into how some of these algorithms are implemented. You will find it at the right level because there is just enough math to explain the fundamental concepts and make them stick in your head. . This isn’t a book on implementing these concepts or a bunch of algorithms. This gives the book the advantage of being something you can refer to an intelligent manager or interested developer, and they can both get a lot out of it. And if they are interested in the next level of learning there are plenty of pointers. You will also find the chapter on presenting results through ROC curves, lift curves, etc. pretty interesting. It would be cool if this book had some more hands-on, but you can go to Kaggle and browse around the current and past competitions to apply what you learn here. . https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449361323/ . Courses to attend . . Machine Learning . . https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning . Machine Learning is one of the first programming MOOCs. Coursera put online by Coursera founder and Stanford Professor Andrew Ng. This course assumes that you have basic programming skills and you have some understanding of Linear Algebra. Knowledge of Statistics &amp; Probability is not required though. . Andrew Ng does a good job explaining dense material and slides. The course gives you a lot of structure and direction for each homework, so it is generally pretty clear what you are supposed to do and how you are supposed to do it. . Deep Learning . . When you are rather new to the topic, you can learn a lot of doing the deeplearning.ai specialization. First and foremost, you learn the basic concepts of NN. How does a forward pass in simple sequential models look like, what’s a backpropagation, and so on? I experienced this set of courses as a very time-effective way to learn the basics and worth more than all the tutorials, blog posts and talks, which I went through beforehand. . Doing this specialization is probably more than the first step into DL. I would say, each course is a single step in the right direction, so you end up with five steps in total. I think it builds a fundamental understanding of the field. But going further, you have to practice a lot and eventually it might be useful also to read more about the methodological background of DL variants. But doing the course work gets you started in a structured manner — which is worth a lot, especially in a field with so much buzz around it. . [embed]https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2019/03/01/the-myth-of-ais-predictive-power/[/embed] . Fast AI . . If your goal is to be able to learn about deep learning and apply what you’ve learned, the fast.ai course is a better bet. If you have the time, interleaving the deeplearning.ai and fast.ai courses is ideal — you get the practical experience, applicability, and audience interaction of fast.ai, along with the organised material and theoretical explanations of deeplearning.ai. . [embed]https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2019/03/01/the-myth-of-ais-predictive-power/[/embed] . Kaggle Learn . . Practical data skills you can apply immediately: that’s what you’ll learn in these free micro-courses. They’re the fastest (and most fun) way to become a data scientist or improve your current skills. . [embed]https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2019/03/01/the-myth-of-ais-predictive-power/[/embed] .

HackerMath for Machine Learning . . Math literacy, including proficiency in Linear Algebra and Statistics, is a must for anyone pursuing a career in data science. The goal of this workshop is to introduce some key concepts from these domains that get used repeatedly in data science/AI applications. . As outlined by Amit Kapoor, “Our approach is what we call the ‘Hacker’s way’. Instead of going back to formulae and proofs, we teach the concepts by writing code. And in practical applications. Concepts don’t remain sticky if the usage is never taught.” . The focus here is on depth rather than breadth. Three areas are chosen — Hypothesis Testing, Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning. They are covered to sufficient depth — 50% of the time on the concepts and 50% of the time spent coding them. .

            "title": "Artificial Intelligence from Novice to Professional",
            "content": ". Why this post? . There is a general notion that Artificial Intelligence is all about algorithms. If you look around most of the courses, books, blogs, etc, you will find that most of them cover how you can apply certain algorithms and further optimize those algorithms. . After working on a few real-world AI/ML projects, you will realize that while algorithms are at the core, AI is much more than algorithms. From identifying &amp; assessing AI opportunities in your organization/department to deploying and maintaining the solutions in production, a lot goes into AI/ML projects. . In this post, I am going to briefly touch every aspect of AI/ML project lifecycle. The good news is, as a data scientist you need not master every aspect, but knowing those areas to some extent will help you contribute better in real-world projects. . A single post can’t make you an AI professional, but it can ask relevant questions &amp; increase awareness, seeking answers to these questions can help you build your own AI roadmap. . We can segregate all these aspects of AI into 5 parts: AI Introduction, AI Pre-requisites, AI Concepts &amp; Algorithms, Enterprise AI &amp; Peripherals of AI . I. AI Introduction . AI is a team game, every aspiring AI role needs to have a common understanding of AI/ML field. This part covers a simple What, Why &amp; How of AI: . — Why you should learn AI? . — Why AI is important? . — What is Artificial Intelligence? . — How an end-to-end AI project looks like? . — What are the roles in AI projects and who does what? . II. AI Pre-requisites . AI/ML has a steep learning curve because it is an amalgamation of many fields (Statistics, IT &amp; Domain etc). And some knowledge of these fields is required before you can start grasping AI/ML concepts. This part covers the pre-requisites of AI: . — What topics of maths you should cover? . — What programming languages, libraries &amp; frameworks you should be aware of? . — How does data move in an organization? . — How is it stored and processed? . III. AI Concepts &amp; Algorithms . AI/ML in itself is quite a vast field and have different techniques and frameworks to deal with different kind of real-world problems. This part covers major AI/ML techniques and what to use when: . — What are the major types of AI techniques? . — When to use what? Main concepts &amp; algorithms ML, DL &amp; RL? . IV. Enterprise AI . Learning AI/ML concepts &amp; algorithms are not enough, you will be solving some business problems with what you have learned. You need to be aware of what happens when these concepts &amp; algorithms are applied within an enterprise. This part covers the aspects of enterprise AI: . - What is the difference between Hackathons &amp; Real-world projects? . - How to operationalize AI? . - How to build AI Strategy? . - Why ethics &amp; explainability is important &amp; how can we make AI explainable? . V. Peripherals of AI . Apart from learning concepts and their applications, you may have specific needs at the moment like you want to get into the AI field or you need to lead an AI initiative in your organization. This part covers those specific needs: . - How you can get into AI field? . - How to lead AI initiatives in your organization? . - How to future-proof your AI career? . Conclusion . I hope by now you have got an idea of what it takes to work on AI projects in the real world. Due to different but overlapping fields, it is really hard to get in-depth knowledge of every aspect of an AI aspirant. . But what you can do is to build a T-shape skill-set in the AI field, where you go in-depth in the aspect of your choice and have handy knowledge of other related aspects. . I will cover the above-mentioned aspects of AI thoroughly in upcoming posts, stay tuned. . . Ankit Rathi is an AI architect, published author &amp; well-known speaker.

            "title": "4 Types of Challenges in DS/AI Projects & Initiatives",
            "content": ". In this post, I have analyzed frequent challenges encountered by DS/AI leaders &amp; experts in their projects/initiatives. I have re-organized these challenges into 4 areas of concerns, my idea is to build a framework around these challenges to suggest possible solutions in upcoming posts. . . DS/AI promises considerable economic &amp; social benefits, even as it disrupts the way we work. Almost everyone agrees that it is a field which can change the world, from healthcare to countering terrorism and even arts &amp; sports. . DS/AI leaders &amp; experts are facing different challenges from ideation to productization, it is estimated that between 70% and 85% of DS/AI projects fail. . To get a holistic view of the challenges &amp; failures, I looked at various articles available on the internet about the challenges in DS/AI projects &amp; initiatives. You can find all the articles I referred at the end of this post. . In the past few weeks, I have also spoken to many DS/AI leaders &amp; experts on this topic and they have also given some useful insights. I will cover these specific insights into the challenges in the upcoming blog-posts. . In order to shed some light on the reasons why we observe such a high failure rate, I also analyzed the results of a survey conducted by Kaggle in 2017. You can see the full report here. The part of the survey relevant to this article is about the challenges companies face as far as their DS/AI efforts are concerned. The following chart shows the top fifteen challenges: . . While I am still documenting the challenges &amp; possible solutions, I can categorize these challenges in four broad segments: — Cultural challenges (right talent, data literacy, realistic expectations etc) — Data-related challenges (data access, data quality, lifecycle management etc) — Operational challenges (suitable operating model with specific roles &amp; responsibilities) — Technology-related challenges (appropriate tech-stack, right infrastructure etc). . . Challenges in DS/AI Projects . Based on the above-mentioned sources (surveys, articles &amp; experts) in this post, I have collected all the challenges and tried to categorize them into four areas of concern — Culture, Operation, Data, Technology: . Data Quality — Data | Talent Gap — Operations | Company Politics — Culture | Data Access — Operations | Data Literacy — Culture | Data Privacy — Data | SME Gap — Operations | Heterogeneous Tech-stack — Technology | Unrealistic Expectations — Culture | Co-ordination with IT &amp; other deptt — Operations | Stakeholders’ Buy-in — Culture | Sponsorship — Culture | Deployment — Operations | Algorithms Limitations — Technology | Data Consolidation — Data | Opportunity Assessment — Operations | Model Explainability — Technology | Agility — Operations | Data Security — Operations | Solving the Wrong Problem — Operations | Organizational Maturity — Culture | Storytelling — Culture | . Area of Concerns in DS/AI . Now, let’s consolidate the above challenges in the respective area of concerns: . Cultural Challenges . Company Politics, Data Literacy, Unrealistic Expectations, Stakeholders’ Buy-in, Organizational Maturity, Storytelling . Operational Challenges . Talent Gap, Data Access, SME Gap, Coordination with IT and other deptts, Deployment, Opportunity Assessment, Data Security, Solving the Wrong Problem . Data Challenges . Data Quality, Data Privacy, Data Consolidation . Technology Challenges . Heterogeneous Tech-stack, Algorithms Limitations, Model Explainability . What next? . I believe that if we categorize these challenges in the respective area of concerns, we can build a framework around it which can address these challenges and suggest possible solutions. . I intend to explore these possibilities in the upcoming blog-posts, if it looks interesting to you, stay tuned. . . Thank you for reading my post.
