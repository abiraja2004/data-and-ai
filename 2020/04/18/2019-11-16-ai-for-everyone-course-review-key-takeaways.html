<p>I am working in ML/AI field for 6 years now and apart from technical skills that I acquired while working on the projects, I have also discussed various aspects of ML/AI with my non-technical colleagues, who have mostly been senior manager, VPs or CXOs.</p>

<p>When I heard about “AI For Everyone” course, I was a bit reluctant in attending it as I thought I know most of the generic stuff that might have been talked in the course.</p>

<p>Recently, one of my colleagues discussed with me a few topics covered in this course which intrigued me to get a fresh perspective on these topics. So, I recently attended this course on Coursera.</p>

<p>My motivation to write this blog is to make sure that I have understood key aspects of this course and am able to make my non-technical colleagues and project stakeholders understand the benefits &amp; limitations of using AI.</p>

<p>This blog will also serve as a refresher for the professionals who have already attended it or are working in AI field but couldn’t attend the course due to time limitation.</p>

<h3 id="review-of-thecourse">Review of the Course</h3>

<p>“AI For Everyone” is a short non-technical course which helps to bridge the gap among corporate professionals who are going to be impacted by AI transformation now or in the near future. Even the professionals without programming background understand the capabilities and limitations of today’s AI, what it takes to incorporate AI into your company’s strategy, how some of the fear regarding AI is overhyped and finally many serious questions like how AI will impact repetitive automation-prone jobs.</p>

<p>Key aspects of this course are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A non-technical overview of AI field</li>
  <li>Mainly for non-technical staff including executives (VPs &amp; CXOs)</li>
  <li>Refresher for AI starters &amp; enthusiasts</li>
  <li>Brings all stakeholders for AI projects on the same page</li>
  <li>Mostly covers benefits &amp; limitations of AI</li>
</ul>

<p>In my view, the most important benefit of this course is that it brings all the professionals on the same page about what is AI? What are its capabilities? Which really fills a lot of gaps for the people joining AI projects from different background and reduces the friction while working together.</p>

<h3 id="outline-of-thecourse">Outline of the Course</h3>

<p>Let’s have a look at what we are going to learn in this course:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First week: AI technology, what is AI and what is machine learning? What’s supervised learning, that is learning inputs, outputs, or A to B mappings. As well as what is data science, and how data feeds into all of these technologies? What AI can and cannot do?</li>
  <li>Second week: What it feels like to build an AI project? What is the workflow of machine learning projects, of collecting data, building a system and deploying it, as well as the workflow of data science projects? How to carry out technical diligence to make sure a project is feasible, together with business diligence to make sure that the project is valuable before you commit to taking on a specific AI project?</li>
  <li>Third week: How such AI projects could fit in the context of our company? Examples of complex AI products, such as a smart speaker, a self-driving car. What are the roles and responsibilities of large AI teams? The AI transmission playbook, what are the five-steps for helping a company become a great AI company?</li>
  <li>Last week: AI and Society. What are the limitations of AI beyond just technical ones? How AI is affecting developing economies and jobs worldwide?</li>
</ul>

<p>This week’s content contains all the essentials for understanding AI, its capabilities, limitations, and how to implement it in a company’s automated processes to become an AI company.</p>

<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

<ul>
  <li>AI is creating value in almost all the sectors</li>
  <li>Artificial Intelligence can be categorized broadly into two streams: ANI &amp; AGI</li>
  <li>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): Machine can do whatever a human can do</li>
  <li>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI): Machine can do very specific tasks like driving cars, playing asked music, searching web etc</li>
  <li>What we know how to develop today are ANIs, each specialized in one task</li>
  <li>AGI doesn’t exist yet (at least for a long time from now)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h4>

<ul>
  <li>AI has really taken off recently due to the rise of neural networks and deep learning</li>
  <li>In the majority of the cases: AI → Machine Learning → Supervised Learning</li>
  <li>Supervised Learning learns the mapping between input A to output B</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-isdata">What is data</h4>

<ul>
  <li>We know that Supervised Learning learns the mapping between input A to output B</li>
  <li>Examples of input A &amp; output B from which ML algorithms learn is called data</li>
  <li>Data is often unique to your business, can be structured (tables, hierarchy etc), unstructured ( text, voice and image) or semi-structured</li>
  <li>Data can be obtained by: manual labeling, observing behaviours or download from websites/partnerships</li>
  <li>Pre-process the data before using it for AI models: garbage in, garbage out</li>
  <li>Most of the data problems are related to incorrect labels &amp; missing values</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-terminology-ofai">The terminology of AI</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Business Intelligence (BI) helps interpret past data, BI is mainly used for reporting or Descriptive Analytics.</li>
  <li>Data Science is the science of extracting knowledge and insights from data which often ends up being captured in a deck.</li>
  <li>Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.</li>
  <li>The Machine Learning which is a subset of the AI ​​itself contains subsets of which the most powerful is the Deep Learning (DL<strong>).</strong></li>
  <li>Originally inspired by neural networks of the brain, DL models are composed of several layers of computational units (artificial neurons), each capable of detecting more and more complicated characteristics of a training dataset</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-makes-an-aicompany">What makes an AI company?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Any company + deep learning != AI company</li>
  <li>Strategic data acquisition</li>
  <li>Unified data warehouse</li>
  <li>Pervasive automation</li>
  <li>New roles &amp; division of labour</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="5-steps-to-becoming-an-aicompany">5 steps to becoming an AI company</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Execute pilot projects to gain momentum</li>
  <li>Build an in-house AI team</li>
  <li>Provide broad AI training</li>
  <li>Develop an AI strategy</li>
  <li>Develop internal &amp; external communications</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-machine-learning-can-and-cannotdo">What Machine Learning can and cannot do</h4>

<ul>
  <li>ML/AI can’t do everything</li>
  <li>Expectations are inflated due to media, academics &amp; only positive reports about AI</li>
  <li>Imperfect rule: Whatever we could do with a second of thought can probably be automated using AI</li>
  <li>Technical diligence is required to assess the feasibility of the project</li>
  <li>It is still harder to contextualize the responses for AI models</li>
  <li>ML tends to work well in learning a simple concept with lots of available data</li>
  <li>ML tends to work poorly in learning a complex concept, especially from small amount of data or if performing on new type of data</li>
</ul>
